# What is a Tech Radar? üß≠

A tech radar is a tool for visualizing the status, maturity, and adoption of various technologies within an organization or project. It categorizes technologies into different quadrants (e.g., languages, tools, platforms, and techniques) and stages (e.g., adopt, trial, assess, hold), providing a clear picture of which technologies to invest in, experiment with, or avoid. This originates from [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

# Purpose of Wayne's Tech Radar ü§î

This tech radar is used to track and manage the technologies utilized in my personal GitHub projects. It helps in:

- Visualizing Progress: Providing a clear snapshot of the current state and evolution of the technologies in use.
- Guiding Decisions: Assisting in making informed decisions about which technologies to adopt, trial, or reassess.
- Documenting Journey: Keeping a record of the technological journey, showing what has been tried, what is being used, and what has been put on hold.

This tech radar ensures that I maintain a structured approach to technology adoption and usage, aligning with best practices and future goals for my personal projects.
